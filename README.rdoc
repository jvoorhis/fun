= Fun

Fun is a functional programming library for Ruby. The library contains abstract
data types and functions that are usually found in functional programming
languages as Haskell, ML or Scheme. While Ruby's syntax is not ideally suited
for the use of these techniques, its flexibility as a multiparadigmatic
programming language certainly makes this possible.
